Task Provided code sub reads two integers form STDIN, a and b. Add code to print three lines where:
1. The first line contains the sum of two numbers.
2. The second line contains the difference of the two numbers(first - second).
3. The third line contains the product of the two numbers.

Example
a = 3
b = 5

print the following:

  8
  -2
  15

Input Format:
The first line contains the first integer, a.
the second line conains the second integer, b.

Constraints:

  1 ≤ a ≤ 10^10
  1 ≤ b ≤ 10^10
  
Output Format:
Print the Three lines as explained above.
